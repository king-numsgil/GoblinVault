Dominating [[Marintha]]'s night sky is the luminary satellite known as Mirazul, a celestial body that manifests both physical majesty and scientific intrigue. Completing its orbit around [[Marintha]] every sixty days, Mirazul weaves a rhythmic dance in the heavens, serving as a constant, reassuring presence in the alien sky.

Mirazul’s size, relative to its parent planet, is notably larger than the Earth-Moon ratio, making it an imposing figure against the velvety backdrop of the cosmos. As seen from [[Marintha]]’s surface, it forms a grand portrait of heavenly bodies, bestowing an ethereal glow upon the planet that further adds to its enchanting appeal.

In the absence of [[Finistella]]'s light, Mirazul unveils its unique characteristic, a trait that has deeply rooted itself in the heart of every Marinthan - its distinctive blueish tint. While most moons in the cosmos display a pale, silvery luminescence, Mirazul defies this convention. Its surface reflects a surreal, azure hue that swathes [[Marintha]] in an otherworldly glow, bathing the landscape in hues that stir the soul. The moon’s surface composition, rich in minerals with high reflectivity in the blue wavelength, results in this celestial spectacle that has inspired countless tales and artworks among the settlers.

The terrain of Mirazul is a diverse patchwork of plains, craters, and mountains. The broad, flat lunar plains, known as maria, are largely responsible for the moon's blueish tint, their smooth basaltic rock surfaces acting as a perfect canvas for this distinctive hue. These expanses are punctuated by the moon's highlands, craggy, rough terrain that rises sharply from the maria, offering a contrast in both color and texture. The highlands, less reflective, appear darker, lending depth and drama to the lunar landscape.

Completing this starkly beautiful picture are the countless craters that pockmark Mirazul's surface. These celestial scars are remnants of the moon's turbulent past, a result of countless meteor impacts. They range from tiny, bowl-shaped depressions to colossal basins, some with intricate systems of rays that extend for hundreds of kilometers, their radial pattern creating a visual spectacle that adds to the overall awe-inspiring appearance of Mirazul.

Mirazul’s gravitational influence on [[Marintha]] results in pronounced tidal patterns, creating a rhythmic ebb and flow in the planet's extensive oceans. These tides not only shape the Marinthan shoreline but also influence the planet's burgeoning marine life, setting the tempo for a host of ecological processes.

Mirazul, with its grandeur, tranquil blue glow, and profound impact on [[Marintha]]'s rhythms, is more than just a moon. It's a celestial symphony playing a never-ending melody, a tangible embodiment of the wondrous strangeness and beauty of this new home among the stars.
