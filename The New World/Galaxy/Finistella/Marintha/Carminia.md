Completing the heavenly diptych of [[Marintha]]'s celestial bodies is the enigmatic satellite named Carminia. Orbiting the planet at a greater distance than its lunar sibling, [[Mirazul]], Carminia takes a full 200 days to complete its unhurried journey around [[Marintha]], tracing a slower, stately arc through the star-flecked expanse of the sky.

From [[Marintha]]'s surface, Carminia appears smaller than [[Mirazul]] due to its further distance, yet it maintains a compelling presence in the sky. Its slower orbit provides a contrasting rhythm to [[Mirazul]]’s swift dance, a celestial timekeeper marking the passage of the seasons on this alien world.

Carminia’s defining feature, and the origin of its name, is its striking, rust-red hue. While [[Mirazul]]’s surface minerals reflect the serene blue wavelengths of light, Carminia's terrain exhibits a completely different chromatic characteristic. Rich in iron compounds, its surface oxidizes in the harsh conditions of space, giving Carminia its unique, ruddy complexion. As Carminia rises and sets, it paints the Marinthan sky with hues of crimson, terra-cotta, and deep wine, creating a visual spectacle that is mirrored in the planet's waters.

In terms of physical features, Carminia's surface is a fascinating tableau of geological formations. An amalgam of vast flatlands and rugged highlands, it is punctuated by a network of deep valleys and towering cliffs. The largest of these valleys stretches across the lunar surface like a gaping wound, creating a stark contrast against the flat plains. These craggy formations cast dramatic, lengthening shadows as Carminia moves through its phases, rendering the moon's visage a dynamic, ever-changing spectacle.

Carminia's craters, though not as abundant as [[Mirazul]]’s, hold their own charm. From the largest, named the Carminian Eye, to the smaller indentations scattered across its surface, these craters add to the moon's rugged beauty, each holding stories of meteoritic impacts and violent upheavals from Carminia's tumultuous past.

Carminia's gravitational effect on [[Marintha]], though not as pronounced as [[Mirazul]]’s, nevertheless contributes to the planet's tidal activity. Its influence also impacts Marintha's axial tilt and rotation, stabilizing the planet's climate and resulting in a more predictable, gradual progression of seasons.

Carminia, in all its radiant, reddish allure, offers a counterpoint to the cool azure of [[Mirazul]], adding a second voice to the celestial concert enacted in [[Marintha]]'s sky. This copper-tinted orb holds its place in the firmament, a distant but nonetheless integral part of the Marinthan experience, a scarlet jewel adorning the collar of space around this novel, thriving world.
