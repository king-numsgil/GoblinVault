In the boundless tapestry of the stars, cradled in the cosmic sea, lies Marintha, a resplendent orb dancing gracefully around the radiant [[Finistella]]. This celestial sphere, bathed in the ethereal hues of azure and emerald, traces an elegant orbit 2.8 AU distant from its guardian star, a noble Yellow-White Dwarf.

[[Marintha]]'s journey through the heavens unfolds over an epoch-spanning 1440 Earth-days, a majestic cycle that sets the rhythm of existence upon its surface. Each day lingers for 26 hours, bestowing upon its denizens extended moments under the star-kissed heavens and the gentle luminescence of [[Finistella]].

With a grand radius of about 9000 km, [[Marintha]]'s embrace is profound, its gravity—a force 1.4 times that of [[Earth]]'s—anchors all in a loving, unyielding hold. This potent gravity weaves its magic across the realm, sculpting life in forms both wondrous and diverse.

The dominion of [[Marintha]] is an oceanic realm, its surface swathed in ceaseless waters that cover 90% of its breadth. These ancient, undulating seas, deep and enigmatic, are a bastion of life, nurturing countless mysteries within their cerulean depths. The planet, with its minimal axial tilt and gentle orbit, is a world of unending tranquility, bereft of the tumult of seasons, where the climate is as constant as the ageless stars.

In this realm of perpetual oceans and immutable skies, where time itself seems to pause in reverence, the call to adventure echoes. Whether it be in the exploration of the mysterious deeps, the traversing of rare and secluded isles, or the unveiling of the arcane secrets of a planet in harmonious celestial ballet, Marintha stands as a siren to the souls of the brave and the curious, beckoning them to partake in its eternal saga.
