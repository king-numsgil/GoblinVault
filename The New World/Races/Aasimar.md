>![[Aasimar.png|cover hsmall]]

Aasimars are humans with a significant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. While not always benevolent, aasimars are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil, and they gravitate toward faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some aasimars take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. “It's always the one you least suspect” is the axiom these evil aasimars live by, and they often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule.

## Physical Description
Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features include hair that shines like metal, jewel-toned eyes, lustrous skin color, or even glowing, golden halos.

## Society
Aasimars cannot truly be said to have an independent society of their own. As an offshoot of humanity, they adopt the societal norms around them, though most find themselves drawn to those elements of society that work for the redress of injustice and the assuagement of suffering. This sometimes puts them on the wrong side of the law in more tyrannical societies, but aasimars can be careful and cunning when necessary, able to put on a dissembling guise to divert the attention of oppressors elsewhere. While corrupt aasimars may be loners or may establish secret societies to conceal their involvement in crime, righteous aasimars are often found congregating in numbers as part of good-aligned organizations, especially (though not always) churches and religious orders.

## Relations
Aasimars are most common and most comfortable in human communities. This is especially true of those whose lineage is more distant and who bear only faint marks of their heavenly ancestry. It is unclear why the touch of the celestial is felt so much more strongly in humanity than other races, though it may be that humanity's inherent adaptability and affinity for change is responsible for the evolution of aasimars as a distinct race. Perhaps the endemic racial traits of other races are too deeply bred, too strongly present, and too resistant to change. Whatever dalliances other races may have had with the denizens of the upper planes, the progeny of such couplings are vanishingly rare and have never bred true.

However, even if they generally tend toward human societies, aasimars can become comfortable in virtually any environment. They have an easy social grace and are disarmingly personable. They get on well with half-elves, who share a similar not-quite-human marginal status, though their relations are often less cordial with half-orcs, who have no patience for aasimars' overly pretty words and faces. Elven courtiers sometimes dismiss aasimars as unsophisticated, and criticize them for relying on natural charm to overcome faux pas. Perhaps of all the known races, gnomes find aasimars most fascinating, and have an intense appreciation for their varied appearances as well as the mystique surrounding their celestial heritage.

> [!kith] Subraces
> ## Angelkin
> Angel-blooded aasimars-called angelkin by many-follow the righteous paths their celestial ancestors walked, and are as varied as angels in how they go about their virtuous duties, split evenly among those who embrace law, neutrality, or chaos.
> Of all the aasimars, angelkin are the type who perhaps most often clash with tieflings. Angelkin have difficulty embracing the idea of harmony when it comes to their corrupt cousins, and most see tieflings as embodiments of evil that can never be trusted. It takes extraordinary circumstances for most angelkin to cooperate with tieflings, and even then, alliances are rarely more than fleeting.
> Angelkin are commonly found in Varisia-due in large part to the free-roaming spirit of the native Varisians and their acceptance of signs of the divine-as well as large city centers such as Absalom and Oppara. Because many angelkin feel called to the life of a crusader or paladin, they can often be found in Andoran, fighting against oppression and slavery, as well as near the Worldwound, where they campaign against demons.
> **Ancestry** Angel
> **Typical Alignment** Any good
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Str, +2 Cha
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Heal, Knowledge (planes)
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Angelkin gain _alter self_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Emberkin
> Emberkin reveal their divine heritage through their skill with fire-based magic and their desire to repent for others' sins. Many emberkin suffer from frequent nightmares and strange impulses to commit spontaneous acts of evil. They typically have igneous features such as wispy auburn hair and bright yellow eyes, and a rare few are born with albino skin.
> Emberkin often feel an insatiable need to continually perform acts of good. Some are content to perform small acts of kindness at home, though they may feel driven to travel regularly in order to find pockets of true evil that they can eradicate. Emberkin can often be found in tumultuous regions such as Cheliax, Galt, and the Shackles, where they combat injustice in its myriad forms.
> Like all aasimars, emberkin are not necessarily compelled to embrace good and justice. Perhaps more so than most of their celestial kith, emberkin have a propensity to revolt against their benevolent predisposition and instead follow a darker path. Perhaps these emberkin are evil by nature, or perhaps it is a remnant of their fallen angel ancestry. Either way, such wicked individuals are often dangerous, and are both pitied and hunted down by their aasimar brethren.
> **Ancestry** Peri
> **Typical Alignment** NG
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Int, +2 Cha
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Knowledge (planes), Spellcraft
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Emberkin gain _pyrotechnics_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Idyllkin
> Like their agathion ancestors, idyllkin seek to spread good in its purest form, unconcerned with the trivialities of chaos and law. They often travel from place to place to spread their righteous wisdom, and recruit both intelligent creatures and animals to their cause.
> Idyllkin often possess bestial qualities such as dragon scales, fish scales, fur, manes, or talons. Slit pupils, pronounced canines, and furry ears are all common indicators of an aasimar's agathion background. Just as agathions take on different traits depending on their animal aspect, so too do idyllkin. Descendants of avorals often possess feathery hair and enjoy wide-open areas such as plains, while the progeny of leonals are aggressive and often have sharp, clawlike fingernails. Many idyllkin, regardless of their animal aspect, feel called to walk the path of the druid, and idyllkin are among the most likely aasimars to become such protectors of nature.
> Idyllkin are usually found in the wild reaches of Golarion, such as Kyonin, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, or the Mwangi Expanse. They prefer villages to cities, and often work as hunters, herbalists, or herders if they haven't carved out their own existence in the wilderness. They often put the ailments of nature and life before those of society and wealth, but when working with others idyllkin compromise to make sure everyone's goals are met.
> **Ancestry** Agathion
> **Typical Alignment** NG
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Con, +2 Cha
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Handle Animal, Survival
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Idyllkin gain _summon nature’s ally II_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Lawbringers
> Lawbringers reflect the patience of their archon ancestors in their daily lives; they understand the need for rules and routines, and use their inherent discipline to train in their chosen field as they seek to do good. They develop their talents faster than most of their peers and show exceptional skill at whatever they focus their attention on.
> Lawbringers feel most comfortable in regions where a clear hierarchy and system of justice exists, preferably alongside good people and honest rulers. Many archon-blooded aasimars can be found in Andoran, Lastwall, Mendev, and Molthune; lawbringers in Mendev are often paladins or crusaders who use their homes as a place to rest between excursions into the Worldwound.
> Evil kingdoms that use tyranny and repression to keep their people in line infuriate lawbringers. Aasimars can thus be found in Cheliax, Geb, and Nidal, conducting organized resistances that seek to find the most legitimate and least destructive ways to neutralize the nations' tyrannical governments.
> **Ancestry** Archon
> **Typical Alignment** LG
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Con, +2 Wis
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Intimidate, Sense Motive
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Lawbringers gain _continual flame_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Musetouched
> The capricious aasimars known as musetouched are the most likely of their kind to be found adventuring throughout lands both civilized and remote. Imbued with an undeniable spirit of wanderlust, musetouched feel the constant urge to explore new places, meet new people, and ferret out evil and corruption wherever they lurk.
> Of all the aasimars, musetouched tend to be among the most beautiful by most humans' standards. They possess features with an unearthly charm, such as long, thick hair of a seemingly impossible hue and limpid, jewel-toned eyes. Musetouched are commonly possessed of innate musical talent and a love for melodies, and many train as bards while they wander.
> Their distaste for oppression and innatelove of good draws many musetouched to Andoran and the River Kingdoms, and their beauty and free-roaming spirits endear them to the fortune-tellers and vagabonds ofVarisia. Their drive to visit new lands leads azata-blooded aasimars to explore the farthest shores of Golarion; musetouched from the Inner Sea can be found in Vudra and Tian Xia, as well as the crystalline city of Dehrukani in southern Garund, where they are seen as holy beings truly worthy of worship.
> **Ancestry** Azata
> **Typical Alignment** CG
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Dex, +2 Cha
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Diplomacy, Perform
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Musetouched gain _glitterdust_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Plumekith
> Garudas are noble but impetuous birdlike celestials, and most garuda-blooded aasimars grow graceful feathers during puberty. The majority of these aasimars have shimmering wings; the wings can be of virtually any shade, ranging from metallic colors to muted hues to pure white, or rarely, glossy black. Plumekith are sometimes born with taloned fingers or toes, and occasionally amber eyes like those of an eagle.
> Like their celestial ancestors, plumekith tend to take action at the spur of the moment when their abilities seem needed. Plumekith rush into the heat of battle to face off against evildoers, only stopping to ask questions afterward. Plumekith often have an extreme hatred for nagas and other snakelike creatures, a racial disdain no doubt stemming back to their garuda forebears.
> Plumekith are drawn to high, mountainous regions, and many travel to the Mindspin Mountains ofBelkzen to make war against the savage orcs there. Others make their homes in the FiveKings Mountains, fight gnolls in the Brazen Peaks ofKatapesh, or dwell in the many hills and mountains ofVarisia. Plumekith often claim to be loners, but still crave at least occasional companionship, and when they aren't traveling they often make their homes near towns or small cities.
> **Ancestry** Garuda
> **Typical Alignment** CG
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Dex, +2 Wis
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Acrobatics, Fly
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Plumekith gain _see invisibility_ as a spell-like ability.
