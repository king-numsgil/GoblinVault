>![[Tiefling.png|cover hsmall]]

Simultaneously more and less than mortal, tieflings are the offspring of humans and fiends. With otherworldly blood and traits to match, tieflings are often shunned and despised out of reactionary fear. Most tieflings never know their fiendish sire, as the coupling that produced their curse occurred generations earlier. The taint is long-lasting and persistent, often manifesting at birth or sometimes later in life, as a powerful, though often unwanted, boon. Despite their fiendish appearance and netherworld origins, tieflings have a human's capacity of choosing their fate, and while many embrace their dark heritage and side with fiendish powers, others reject their darker predilections. Though the power of their blood calls nearly every tiefling to fury, destruction, and wrath, even the spawn of a succubus can become a saint and the grandchild of a pit fiend an unsuspecting hero.

## Physical Description
No two tieflings look alike; the fiendish blood running through their veins manifests inconsistently, granting them an array of fiendish traits. One tiefling might appear as a human with small horns, a barbed tail, and oddly colored eyes, while another might manifest a mouth of fangs, tiny wings, and claws, and yet another might possess the perpetual smell of blood, foul incenses, and brimstone. Typically, these qualities hearken back in some way to the manner of fiend that spawned the tiefling's bloodline, but even then the admixture of human and fiendish blood is rarely ruled by sane, mortal laws, and the vast flexibility it produces in tieflings is a thing of wonder, running the gamut from oddly beautiful to utterly terrible.

## Society
Tieflings on the Material Plane rarely create their own settlements and holdings. Instead, they live on the fringes of the land where they were born or choose to settle. Most societies view tieflings as aberrations or curses, but in cultures where there are frequent interactions with summoned fiends, and especially where the worship of demons, devils, or other evil outsiders is legal or obligatory, tieflings might be much more populous and accepted, even cherished as blessings of their fiendish overlords.

Tieflings seldom see another of their own kind, and thus they usually simply adopt the culture and mannerisms of their human parents. On other planes, tieflings form enclaves of their own kind. But often such enclaves are less than harmonious—the diversity of tiefling forms and philosophies is an inherent source of conflict between members of the race, and cliques and factions constantly form in an ever-shifting hierarchy where only the most opportunistic or devious gain advantage. Only those of common bloodlines or those who manage to divorce their worldview from the inherently selfish, devious, and evil nature of their birth manage to find true acceptance, camaraderie, and common ground among others of their kind.

## Relations
Tieflings face a significant amount of prejudice from most other races, who view them as fiend-spawn, seeds of evil, monsters, and lingering curses placed upon the world. Far too often, civilized races shun or marginalize them, while more monstrous ones simply fear and reject them unless forced or cowed into acceptance. But half-elves, half-orcs, fetchlings and—most oddly—aasimars tend to view them as kindred spirits who are too often rejected or who don't fit into most societies by virtue of their birth. The widespread assumption that tieflings are innately evil—ill-founded though it may be—prevents many from easily fitting into most cultures on the Material Plane except in exceedingly cosmopolitan or planar-influenced nations.

> [!kith] Subraces
> ## Beastbrood
> Like their rakshasa ancestors, beastbrood have a taste for luxury and the finer things in life. Predisposed toward arrogance, beastbrood believe that they innately deserve affluence and find any station below that of royalty beneath them. Despite their haughty demeanor, beastbrood typically possess a natural charm that actually causes others to often grant them the deference they consider their birthright. Unless playing a role, beastbrood always act like aristocrats, and usually, they get treated as such.
> Beastbrood usually develop their distinctive traits after childhood, often sometime during adolescence. Such attributes usually hint at an animalistic nature, including slit pupils, fangs, or coats of fur. Unlike most tieflings, beastbrood rarely feel a sense of isolation. Even their bestial features, sleek and well groomed, usually grant them a feral glamor instead of leading to revulsion.
> Beastbrood are most common in Vudra, where rakshasas are more prevalent, but many leave their homeland for better prospects abroad as soon as possible. Vudran folklore has far too many stories about rakshasas to allow their half-blooded offspring to achieve the lavish lifestyle they seek, and most Vudrans oust beastbrood as soon as they are discovered. In other lands, where they are regarded as merely novel instead of cultural bugaboos, beastbrood find it much easier to attain the opulence they crave.

> **Typical Alignment** LE
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Dex, +2 Cha, –2 Wis
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Disguise, Sense Motive
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Beastbrood gain _detect thoughts_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Faultspawn
> Like their asura forebears, faultspawn revel when the gods or their worshipers fail, and take great pleasure in the defacement or destruction of churches and holy sites that don’t align with their individual viewpoints. This innate desire to taunt and ridicule people of opposing beliefs often extends beyond mere bullying, usually finding expression in the art of maiming or utterly destroying whatever their opponents hold most dear. Emotionally abusive, faultspawn steal or vandalize what others find precious, and enjoy rubbing salt in their victims’ wounds.
> Physically, asura-spawn tend to have both masculine and feminine traits, their relative androgyny proving that havoc and deceit are not limited by one’s sex. A considerable number of asura-spawn are even born hermaphrodites.
> Faultspawn are most common in Vudra, though following the death of Aroden a sizable number of asuras have made destructive pilgrimages to those sites where he dallied with the occasional mortal or that most clearly mark his fall. The asura-spawn of the Worldwound take particular pleasure in destroying the zealous crusaders from neighboring Mendev, while even more are born in Rahadoum, whose people share faultspawn’s loathing for the gods.
> **Ancestry** Asura
> **Typical Alignment** LE
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Dex, +2 Wis, –2 Int
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Appraise, Knowledge (local)
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Faultspawn gain _hideous laughter_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Foulspawn
> Thanks to their demodand ancestry, foulspawn have a deep and abiding hatred of religion and conventional morality. However, their sense of heresy goes much further than merely scorning the gods; foulspawn reject any code of behavior that places limits on their actions, whether such restrictions be social, legal, or divine. Their name—representing not just their disgusting personal habits and hygiene, but also their vulgarity and basic indecency—merely hints at how ruthlessly they work to corrupt and debase their surroundings.
> Foulspawn always have at least one physical trait that places them far outside the norm. Whether they are grossly fat, skeletally thin, monstrously tall, or horrifically stunted, they always stand out in a crowd. All foulspawn, regardless of their appearance, have terrible standards of personal cleanliness and grooming.
> Though they are somewhat more common around the Worldwound, foulspawn tend to appear in higher rates throughout all of northern Avistan. Some attribute this to a general lack of civilization and refinement, which attracts demodands and encourages intermingling between these fiends and humanoid natives. Most regard this myth as simply an unfair stereotype, however, since the fact remains that nearly every society produces foulspawn.

> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Intimidate, Knowledge (religion)
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Foulspawn gain _bear’s endurance_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Grimspawn
> Like their daemon ancestors, grimspawn have a great fascination with sickness, decay, and all the ways mortals can die. However, as mortals themselves, they have no choice but to realize they too could suffer all the scourges that blight mortal life. As a way of distancing themselves from such enraging thoughts, grimspawn spend their lives as tourists of disaster, and if unable to find a preexisting calamity in which to revel, they are happy to lend a hand.
> Grimspawn typically appear unhealthy and frail. Though in actuality they are no sicklier than the average person,grimspawn often display symptoms of various diseases, such as a hacking cough, feverish body temperature, or unnaturally pale complexion, and all are painfully thin and tend to look emaciated no matter how much they eat.
> Grimspawn often arise in areas beset by disease, famine, civil unrest, or war. So desperate are the peoples of these lands to replenish their numbers and forget the horrors of the past that the parents of such sickly seeming children go to extraordinary lengths to keep them alive, ignorant of their daemonic taint. As their fiendish children reach adulthood, many parents come to regret their efforts.

> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Disable Device, Sleight of Hand
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Grimspawn gain _death knell_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Hellspawn
> Though as ambitious and willing to seize opportunities as they come, hellspawn are by far the most conservative and conformist of all the tiefling heritages. They tend to accept their lot in life and seldom rebel, instead finding their niches and then quietly accumulating the wealth and power they crave. Their natural talent for identifying the dark appetites of others often proves useful when trying to climb the social ladder, and hellspawn usually leave behind trails of ruined careers and broken lives in their wakes.
> Hellspawn come closest to matching the stereotype of what a tiefling “should” look like. Most have horns, a tail, and eyes with an odd color or unusually shaped pupils.
> Cheliax has a substantial contingent of hellspawn living within its borders. While hellspawn are a despised minority, their ability to make themselves useful has helped them spread throughout Cheliax’s network of client states, especially Isger. Chelish authorities regard hellspawn as officially expendable and scarcely hesitate to put them up on the auction block, dispersing the tieflings to any land that tolerates slavery.

> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Con, +2 Wis, –2 Cha
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Diplomacy, Sense Motive
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Hellspawn gain _pyrotechnics_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Hungerseed
> Oni-spawn are natural bullies who prefer to use threats and force to get what they want rather than persuasion or tact. At best, such brashness tends to win them lackeys rather than actual friends. If thwarted by someone more powerful, hungerseed brood and bide their time, waiting for the perfect moment to stage a bloody rematch. Onispawn always hunger for more bodily pleasures; they share the voracious appetites of their fiendish antecedents, and take immense delight in experiences of the flesh, whether that means food, sex, violence, or other tactile sensations.
> Hungerseed are usually extremely tall and bulky when compared to untainted humans. Similar to their oni ancestors, they appear ready to burst out of their flesh into some more monstrous form. When hungerseed experience strong emotions, their muscles bulge and shift, almost seeming to expand as they hold themselves back. Some individuals possess tusks that protrude from their mouths, and young hungerseed often delight in using their powerful teeth to rip into living birds or other small animals.
> Though hungerseed appear all across Golarion, especially in the wilder regions, they are most common in Tian Xia, the homeland of the oni. Belkzen and Cheliax also have a scattering of oni-spawn in their midst, usually descendants of ogre magi mercenaries and warlords.

> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Hungerseed gain _alter self_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Motherless
> Like their qlippoth forebears, the motherless instinctively despise mortals and their sins, but rather than turning them toward a path of virtue, such scorn instead drives qlippoth-spawn toward bitterness and cynicism. By their reckoning, hypocrisy and sin rule the mortal heart, and thus all mortals deserve little more than extinction. Jaded and leery loners, they see treachery and deceit behind every action, and prefer to stab others in the back before they themselves are betrayed. Perhaps because they have never felt the bond between a mother and her child, qlippoth-spawn are almost always incapable of love, trust, or affection.
> The motherless always display their bizarre deformities at birth. Covered in barbed tentacles, oozing tumors, crudely shaped and stunted appendages, pieces of carapace, or other defects that seem more appropriate for insects and other lower life forms, those who survive their early years learn the true meaning of rejection.
> One of the rarest of all the tiefling heritages, the motherless tend to arise in clusters of half a dozen or so births occurring over roughly the same time period in a village or town. Such infestations are as quick to dissipate as they are to appear, and while somewhat more common near the Worldwound, such outbreaks are still infrequent.

> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** The motherless gain _blur_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Pitborn
> The easily enraged pitborn usually find smashing something the quickest way to calm back down. Of course, since pitborn gain a sense of genuine pleasure from wanton destruction, they break, rip, and rage even when in the best of moods. They revel not just in the spectacle of annihilation but also in the heady sense of power they get from ruining what others love or, even better, need. Pitborn hate the objects of their fury with a burning intensity that never truly cools no matter how much time has passed.
> Born of chaos and mutation, pitborn always have at least one flaw that mars their bodies’ symmetry. Pitborn with subtler flaws like differently colored eyes, mismatched ears, an odd number of fingers, or a birthmark sprawling across one cheek can often hide or explain such traits away. Those with more prominent abnormalities like incompatible limbs, the head of a vestigial twin, or bizarre spines or scales adorning only one side of their bodies find it much more difficult to pass for normal. All pitborn take extreme offense at their disfigurements being pointed out.
> Pitborn flourish in the vicinity of the Worldwound and throughout the Darklands, though much like the random, malevolent evil of their ancestors, they can arise just about anywhere in the world. A pitborn’s birth often follows some natural disaster, almost as if that catastrophe had roused such evil from a long and fitful slumber.

> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Disable Device, Perception
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Pitborn gain _shatter_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Shackleborn
> Like their kyton ancestors, shackleborn possess a reckless cruelty that makes them truly terrifying when they get the upper hand in a dispute. They embrace agony as an essential truth, and believe submitting to pain is the ultimate destiny of all living things. Shackleborn seldom kill an opponent if given a chance to capture one alive, and they rarely go anywhere without tools to bind and torture victims.
> Shackleborn are often born with their skin already mutilated, a garish embroidery of white and purple scars covering their flesh from head to toe. Though this certainly makes them stand out, normally only the most discerning and well-traveled passersby connect these persons with kytons. The irresistible allure of pain compels shackleborn to add to their collection of scars as they age, and many graduate to branding, piercing, and tattooing over time.
> Cheliax plays host to a respectable number of shackleborn. Nidal boasts a number of kyton-born as well; the native Kuthites regard the shadowy tieflings as gifts from their dark patron. Rumors, never confirmed, claim that the priests of Razmir sometimes employ kyton torturers to persuade doubtful acolytes, and their carnal appetites have supposedly produced a small colony of shackleborn trained from birth to serve the living god.

> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Escape Artist, Intimidate
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Shackleborn gain _web_ as a spell-like ability.
> 
> ## Spitespawn
> The ultimate false friends, spitespawn never feel true pleasure or happiness. The closest they can manage is a certain measure of smug satisfaction when they drive others to frustration and despair.
> Spitespawn often have a noticeable abnormality relating to their skin and, in some rare cases, their tongues. Blotches, unusual skin pigmentation, and pelts of thick hair are all subtle signs of div ancestry, but the truly deformed can sport even more bizarre traits including mobile bulges that lurk beneath the skin like burrowing insects, or unusally dry flesh that constantly sheds layers of unsightly dust.
> Spitespawn are most often encountered in areas where both genies and divs are common, including the lands of Jalmeray, Katapesh, Kelesh, Qadira, and Vudra. Regardless of where they are born and raised, almost all spitespawn must travel far away from their homelands at some point, as their scams and treacheries inevitably catch up to them and force them to move on to places where they can make a fresh start and find new victims.
> **Ancestry** Div
> **Typical Alignment** NE
> **Ability Modifiers** +2 Dex, +2 Cha, –2 Int
> **Alternate Skill Modifiers** Diplomacy, Linguistics
> **Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Spitespawn gain _misdirection_ as a spell-like ability.
