Beldor Ironfist, a master of the forge and cleric of deep faith, presents a striking figure. His stout, muscular form is a testament to years spent laboring over anvils and smelters. His beard, a thick cascade of dark hair interwoven with beads etched in ancient Dwarven runes, speaks of his heritage and dedication. Beldor's hands, rough from work but meticulously cared for, are a symbol of his craftsmanship and devotion to his people. His practical yet dignified attire, often consisting of durable fabrics, reflects his straightforward and grounded personality. Beldor's voice, gentle yet firm, resonates with wisdom, advocating for sustainable development and the responsible use of technology.
