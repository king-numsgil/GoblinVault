Theran Shadowmark, with his tiefling heritage, commands attention with his striking appearance. His horns, curling elegantly from his temples, and his tail, wrapped neatly around his waist, are marks of his otherworldly lineage. Theran's skin, a deep red, and his yellow eyes, exude an aura of mystery and power. As a sorcerer with an arcane bloodline, Theran brings to the council a profound understanding of the magical forces that shape [[Marintha]], offering insights that often cut through the complexity of issues.
