Jorak Hammerfell, a half-orc of imposing stature, exudes strength and leadership. His green skin and muscular build are indicative of his orcish heritage, while his thoughtful eyes and articulate speech reveal a keen intellect and strategic mind. Jorak's attire is functional, suited for both industrial work and council duties. As a fighter with a focus on tactics, Jorak brings to the council a strategic approach to problem-solving, always considering the broader implications of their decisions on [[Prosper's Haven]] and [[Marintha]] as a whole.
