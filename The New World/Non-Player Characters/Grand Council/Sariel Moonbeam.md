Sariel Moonbeam, an Aasimar, radiates a celestial beauty that is both awe-inspiring and comforting. Her silver hair and softly glowing eyes are a constant reminder of her celestial heritage. Her robes, elegant and flowing, are adorned with celestial motifs, symbolizing her connection to the higher realms. Sariel's calm and introspective nature provides the council with spiritual and philosophical insights, often reminding them of the ethical and moral dimensions of their decisions. As an Oracle of the Heavens, she brings a broader perspective to the council, guiding their decisions with wisdom that transcends the mundane.
