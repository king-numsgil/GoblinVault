In the twilight of her years, Elara Sunweaver stands as a beacon of wisdom and grace. Her age, merely a number, seems to have forgotten to touch her, leaving behind a woman who carries an air of timeless knowledge. Her hair, once a vibrant chestnut, now bears streaks of silver, cascading like a waterfall down her back, often tied neatly with a ribbon featuring symbols of Marinthan lore. Elara's eyes, sharp and blue, reflect a mind that has traversed the annals of history, seeking wisdom in its pages. Her attire, elegant and adorned with historical motifs, speaks of her reverence for the past. As a Spell Sage wizard, Elara's approach to governance is deeply rooted in historical precedent, providing a stable anchor for her decision-making process.
