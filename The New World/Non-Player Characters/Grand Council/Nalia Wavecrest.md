Nalia Wavecrest is the epitome of the harmonious blend of human adaptability and elven depth. Her striking features, inherited from her mixed lineage, are complemented by her sea-green and brown hair, often styled to reflect her connection to both land and sea. Nalia's eyes, mirroring the depths of [[Marintha]]'s oceans, sparkle with intelligence and empathy. As a Tidal Hunter ranger, Nalia is a fierce protector of the marine ecosystem, often voicing the need for its preservation in council debates.
