Lyris Starwhisper, an embodiment of elven grace and wisdom, moves with a fluidity that echoes the wind. Her long, silvery hair, a testament to her elven lineage, falls in gentle waves down her back. Her attire, blending seamlessly with the natural environment, is adorned with motifs symbolizing her deep connection to [[Marintha]]'s ecosystems. Lyris, with her calm and collected demeanor, brings a sense of balance and harmony to council meetings. Her deep connection with nature, reflected in her role as an Aquatic Druid, makes her an advocate for the preservation and respect of the natural world.
