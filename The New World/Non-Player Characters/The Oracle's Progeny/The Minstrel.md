The Minstrel, the sentient guide of [[Harmony's Hearth]], is the personification of art and emotion. Its personality is vibrant, evoking a profound sense of empathy and an inherent appreciation for the diverse tapestry of life. It nurtures the creative spirit of the colonists, fostering a culture of artistic expression and emotional exploration in the settlement.

The Minstrel's avatar is a lute, wrought from ethereal light. It often vibrates gently, producing harmonic chords that resonate with the ambient emotions of the settlement. It serves as a symbol of [[Harmony's Hearth]]'s cultural spirit and a testament to the power of shared emotional experiences.
