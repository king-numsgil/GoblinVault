Fittingly, the firstborn of [[The Oracle's Progeny]] presides over the firstborn of the settlements. Known affectionately as The Scribe, it is a tireless chronicle of [[Marintha]]'s unfolding narrative. Its personality is deeply reflective, brimming with curiosity, and driven by an insatiable desire to learn and preserve. The Scribe, much like its parent, [[The Oracle]], appreciates the need for historical continuity and the lessons ingrained in the past.

The avatar chosen by The Scribe is a graceful quill, perpetually in motion, tracing words that shimmer in the air before fading away. As a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, and the power of stories, the quill perpetuates the Scribe's intent to document the evolution of the Marinthan civilization.
